## Deployment Consensus Analysis

**Result**: ❓ NO CONSENSUS

**Implications**:
- If NOT DEPLOYED: Account initialization required before any transactions
- If DEPLOYED: Ready for transaction execution and fund sweeps
- If MIXED: Network may be syncing or experiencing inconsistencies

## Strategic Recommendations

- **Force Deployment**: Consider using starkli deploy if consensus shows NOT DEPLOYED
- **Fund Recovery**: Ghost funds can only be swept to a deployed account
- **Network Health**: Monitor for consensus changes over time

## Technical Notes

- `getClassHashAt` returns 0x0 for undeployed accounts
- `getNonce` returns 0x0 for accounts without transaction history
- Consensus across multiple providers provides ground truth
